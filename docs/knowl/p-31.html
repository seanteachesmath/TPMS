<div class="para">I don’t recall how to get the commented parts to function, but their original purpose was so that I could have more than one of these lists and so that <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> could tell them apart. I found the setup for this within a Stack Exchange post a couple years back while working on a document for my independent study. Stack Exchange is a very helpful website for when you have a question for how to do something specific. It’s heavily used by programmers, and they have plenty of posts for stuff like <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> as well. I found it interesting that \phantom{} worked to leave an item’s line empty even though it had nothing within its argument. I also found it interesting that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\:{o}</code> didn’t work to add the two dots above the o; I also tried using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\..{o}</code>, but that did not work either. I am happy to learn the description environment for case-based lists like in proofs. With the notes about powers of powers, I believe the higher exponential operation has precedence over the lower operation. In other words and from my understanding, without parentheses, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">t^{2^{2}}</code> is the proper way to represent it, but if you needed to represent it the other way, it should be represented as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(t^{2})^{2}</code>. To tell the difference between L’s and Pipe’s in the tabular environment’s argument, it may help to group them, maybe each column is separated by a space since those don’t appear to affect the end result. In other words, a single vertical bar (one L) would mean left-aligned with no bar to the right and two vertical bars (an L and a Pipe) would mean left-aligned with a bar to the right. For example, if we want three left aligned columns with a bar between the first two, we could set the tabular environment’s argument to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">{l| l l}</code>.</div>
