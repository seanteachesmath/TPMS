  "body": " Preface  I encourage you to use this class as an opportunity to treat computers as scientific tools. All computers are slightly different, so dont be afraid to look at the preferences of the program to add line numbers to code, enable syntax highlighting (so commands shine in bright colors), or to make fonts larger in your text editor , Stare at error messages and try to pick out key words, keep a close eye on the differences between { , [ , and ( and their partners, and the direction you make your slashes.  This version of the notes is written with PreTeXt, a latex -compatible, but accessibility-friendly, web-based platform.

We will test latex by opening a blank document and building up features based on classroom requests.    Review  We did some of our work using accounts on .  With software (in this case Overleaf) in hand, we opened a mostly blank document, set up the main structure of the document, and practiced typing text and compiling. In the main structure we set the document class, began the document, and added content to the preamble to generate title page information.  The following links will help you install the appropriate software for your computer. The interface TeXworks Software interface, TeXWorks on Windows OS (link)  OS , Windows computers additionally Windows users will need to install an engine either TeXLive (link - look for install-tl-windows.exe)  Software engine , TexLive or MikTeX Software engine , MiKTeX (link - look for basic-miktex-##.##-x64.exe) . You will want to plug your computer in, turn off any antivirus software (these are safe programs), and give yourself plenty of time for the downloads. Things are a bit easier on Mac OS, we use TeXshop Software interface , TeXshop that comes from the MacTeX Software engine , MacTeX installer on Mac OS (link)  OS , Mac .  There are plenty of other options, take some time to explore and find a configuration you enjoy using.  .    Student perspective  Anybody have any interesting observations to share? Going forward you will have an opportunity to share what you have taken away from a class day of your choosing.  You might highlight something interesting, surprising, confusing, annoying, or otherwise important.   "

Should night mode be activated to any extent, it can wash out colors and lower readability. If your IDE does not readily support a desired color scheme, there will be another that does.

Review    Student perspective  I am not very great at expressing myself in real life, but strangely, I'm very expressive online. I use emojis, I use funny fonts and I change the size of texts to emphasize words in place of emotion. So, being able to use programming to change the fonts, the size of the text and especially the colors is a huge deal for me. Additionally, I have a secret hobby for writing and this gives me total control to tell a story exactly the way I want to. Finally, when it comes to note taking, I like to use certain colors or fonts to draw attention to specific key points. These new skills we learned are a major game changer when taking notes on a computer.   "
