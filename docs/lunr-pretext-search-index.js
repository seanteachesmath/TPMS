  "body": " Preface  I encourage you to use this class as an opportunity to treat computers as scientific tools. All computers are slightly different, so dont be afraid to look at the preferences of the program to add line numbers to code, enable syntax highlighting (so commands shine in bright colors), or to make fonts larger in your text editor , Stare at error messages and try to pick out key words, keep a close eye on the differences between { , [ , and ( and their partners, and the direction you make your slashes.

With software (in this case Overleaf) in hand, we opened a mostly blank document, set up the main structure of the document, and practiced typing text and compiling. In the main structure we set the document class, began the document, and added content to the preamble to generate title page information.  The following links will help you install the appropriate software for your computer. The interface TeXworks Software interface, TeXWorks on Windows OS (link)  OS , Windows computers additionally Windows users will need to install an engine either TeXLive (link - look for install-tl-windows.exe)  Software engine , TexLive or MikTeX Software engine , MiKTeX (link - look for basic-miktex-##.##-x64.exe) .

Review     Day 4 Notes (tex) .   Day 4 Notes (pdf) .      Student perspective  I am not very great at expressing myself in real life, but strangely, I'm very expressive online. I use emojis, I use funny fonts and I change the size of texts to emphasize words in place of emotion. So, being able to use programming to change the fonts, the size of the text and especially the colors is a huge deal for me. Additionally, I have a secret hobby for writing and this gives me total control to tell a story exactly the way I want to. Finally, when it comes to note taking, I like to use certain colors or fonts to draw attention to specific key points. These new skills we learned are a major game changer when taking notes on a computer.   "

Student perspective  I found the setup for this within a Stack Exchange post a couple years back while working on a document for my independent study. Stack Exchange is a very helpful website for when you have a question for how to do something specific. It's heavily used by programmers, and they have plenty of posts for stuff like latex as well. I found it interesting that \\phantom{} worked to leave an item's line empty even though it had nothing within its argument. I also found it interesting that \\:{o} didn't work to add the two dots above the o; I also tried using \\..{o} , but that did not work either. I am happy to learn the description environment for case-based lists like in proofs. With the notes about powers of powers, I believe the higher exponential operation has precedence over the lower operation. In other words and from my understanding, without parentheses, t^{2^{2}} is the proper way to represent it, but if you needed to represent it the other way, it should be represented as (t^{2})^{2} . To tell the difference between L's and Pipe's in the tabular environment's argument, it may help to group them, maybe each column is separated by a space since those don't appear to affect the end result. In other words, a single vertical bar (one L) would mean left-aligned with no bar to the right and two vertical bars (an L and a Pipe) would mean left-aligned with a bar to the right. For example, if we want three left aligned columns with a bar between the first two, we could set the tabular environment's argument to {l| l l} .   "
