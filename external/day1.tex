\section{Introduction to Calculus}
In calculus, we typically learn about limits, derivatives, and integrals. In calculus, we typically learn about limits, derivatives, and integrals. In calculus, we typically learn about limits, derivatives, and integrals. In calculus, we typically learn about limits, derivatives, and integrals. In calculus, we typically learn about limits, derivatives, and integrals. 

A key to all of this is the concept of a function. Consider the function \(f(x) = x^2\).
%% \( ... \) has a distinct open and close
%%% $ ... $ reuses the same symbol for two things
%%% \[ ... \] makes display-style math
As we begin, consider also the more complicated function, \[g(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}\]
